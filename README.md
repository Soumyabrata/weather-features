*Visualization of the various weather variables in a lower dimensional subspace spanned by the first two principal components. The rain and no rain data points are represented as blue circles and green squares, respectively.*

## Code Organization
All codes are written in MATLAB. 

### Code 
The scripts to reproduce the figures in the paper are `figure1.m`, `figure2.m`, and `figure3_and_4.m`.

### Data 
We also share the dataset used in the paper. The dataset is uploaded in `.mat` format, and contains the information pertaining to all the variables. We collect the data from the rooftop of a building at Nanyang Technological University Singapore.
